# Brainiac Cards
## Learn vocabulary through active recall and repetition
[Brainiac Cards Deployed App](https://braniac-cards.herokuapp.com/)
This web application allows users to study vocabulary in an interactive way. The database is populated with the famous 100 Words Every High School Graduate Should Know. Additionally, users:
See a word and think of the definition
Have the ability to see synonyms
See the definition of the word
Rate their knowledge of the definition on a 1-3 scale
Once words are rated they are saved to a database, which when viewed is sorted based on userâ€™s selected word difficulty level.

Additional options: 
Upload your own words, definitions, and synonyms 
View saved cards in a carousel-style card viewer 
Delete user-uploaded flashcards
