# Brainiac Cards
## Learn vocabulary interactively through active recall and repetition
[Brainiac Cards Deployed App](https://braniac-cards.herokuapp.com/) 


This web application allows users to study vocabulary in an interactive way. The database is populated with the famous _100 Words Every High School Graduate Should Know_. To practice vocabulary, users:
 1. See a word and think of the definition
 2. Have the ability to see synonyms
 3. See the definition of the word
 4. Rate their knowledge of the definition based on a 1-3 scale

Once words are rated they are saved to a database, which sorts words based on userâ€™s selected difficulty level.

### Additional options: 
* Upload your own words, definitions, and synonyms 
* View saved cards in a carousel-style card viewer 
* Delete user-uploaded flashcards
